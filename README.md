# Programming in C Practice

The purpose of this repo is to practice the examples for Programming in C book 4th edition. I hope to also add notes from what I learn on the way through this book.

## Exercises

On my mac to run the code either run the compiled programs using the compiled program name or to compile using `gcc {prognam}.c`.
